 <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LICENSE-mit-green"/>
 ## Description

 This week I was tasked to create a simple daily planner. The user should be able to save events for each hour of a nine to five schedule. The CSS and HTML should be updated dynamically using jQuery and the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library.

 ## Requirements:

 * Current day displayed at the top of the calendar
 * Time blocks for standard business hours
 * Past, present, and future hours are color coded differently
 * Able to create an event when time block is clicked
 * Event gets saved to local storage
 * Saved event persists on refresh
